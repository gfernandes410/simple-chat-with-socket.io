## Simple chat with socket.io

This is a simple implementation of a simple chat using node.js and socket.io. I use this to study this new (to me) framework and lear how to make a chat app. Feel free to open issues and pull requests to improve

Just clone and run `npm i`then `npm run dev` at the terminal. 

Open index.html in navegator and you are ready to go.

All of the magic happens in `server.js`. This file open the port and control all of the use of the framework. The script.js holds all the comunication with the front.
